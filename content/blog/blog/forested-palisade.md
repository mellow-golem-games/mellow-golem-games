Today we have a sample map of a forested palisade manned by guards. This is a perfect little setting for traveling between towns, and works great as a slight diversion or hub for further quests.

## Location Overview

This simple camp is a crucial choke point along a well traveled trade route. Nestled in a forest along the main road, it encompasses a small island where both neighboring cities station troops in an effort to provide a safe resting place for traders traveling between them. The river here is fairly deep and fast moving. While not impossible to cross it would certainly be a challenge.


## Map Guide

#### 1. Bridges

Both bridges are under constant watch by the two guard towers in camp. Any travelers taking the main road would certainly be spotted and questioned as they come into camp. The guards won't be outright hostile to simple travelers, but are simply protecting themselves.


#### 2. Watch Commander's Tent

The commander's tent as well as the armory for the camp. The commander is switched out every two weeks with a fresh one. This is generally seen as an unfavorable location, and therefore most commanders won't be in the best mood while on duty.

#### 3. Provisioner

A small shop setup to re-supply traders as well as give the guards of the camp extras they can purchase. He will generally sell to adventurers (see late resupply in hooks) but will ration as to not go out of stock.

#### 4. Common Area

The common area of the camp. Here you can likely find a few off duty guards as well as a 50% chance of a small merchant caravan that has stopped to rest. It will have 1-2 traders as well as 1D4+1 guard and will depart the next day.

## Hooks

#### 1. Missing Resupply

The next resupply from the north is 5 days late. It's not uncommon to be a day or two late, but 5 days is concerning. The commander is willing to pay for someone to investigate as he can't spare any guards if there is something nasty about. During this time the provisioner will be even more guarded of what little stock he has left.

#### 2. Sounds in The Woods

Howling and thrashing has been heard from the woods at night. Nothing has ben spotted yet, but this is concerning as the area is usually quiet.

#### 3. An Ill Omen

A dead horse was found just over the river yesterday and it has the guards on edge. Normally it would be blamed on wolves, but the horse was simply killed and not eaten.

#### 4. Rising Tensions

The current guard duty is split between both nearby cities and some recent bad blood is beginning to boil over. The groups aren't openly hostile yet, but it's getting close. Even worse, the next guard switch is still 7 days away, more than enough time for violence ot occur.
