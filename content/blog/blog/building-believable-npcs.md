NPCs are the lifeblood of any good role playing game. Whether it’s played on the tabletop or on the screen, NPCs make up a good amount of interaction your players will have. Good ones help drive the story and make the world feel alive, while bad ones can make everything seem stale and ruin immersion.

In this article I wanted to go over some of the techniques I use for building out my NPCs. We’ll talk about what makes a good NPC, and at the end I’ll provide some random tables to help you quickly generate some of your own characters. So, let’s jump right in!

Understand The Purpose of The NPC

First off, it’s important to understand why you’re adding an NPC into the game and how the players are going to interact with them. The more important or more time that will be spent with the character the more sense it makes to spend some time on them. If it’s a one-off character then it doesn’t really make sense to spend too much time fleshing them out.

Before you jump in and start planning out a character make sure it’s worth it. For small roles, like random townsfolk in a bar, I don’t generally spend more than a few seconds figuring out who they are. I only really suggest going through and building deep characters if they’re going to be involved in the game for some time. If you’re looking to just create a bunch of throw-away characters then skip to the end, there’s a section that walks through a quick process to get a lot of shallow NPCs quickly.


## The 4 Keys

The biggest thing that you’re looking to do to make your NPCs more interesting is to make it seem like they have a life outside of the game. Sure, he might be a shopkeep to your NPCs, but even the lowly shopkeep has a life outside of their store. This is easier said than done though.

To that effect, I always start out with 4 big questions that help me flesh out my NPCs. Each of these helps build believable characters, and fills in details that can help make them seem alive.

### A Backstory

First off, what’s this person's story, why are they who they are and how did they get here. Taking the shopkeeper above, maybe he’s a world class competitor in archery and runs the shop as a side business after retiring.

This is also a good place to drop some hints that the players can pick up on. The shopkeeper might keep an ornamental bow hung up in his shop or have trophies of his past exploits. This helps show some of the story behind this character without being too blatant about it and still being believable. That’s also another important point that the environment can help tell the story of your character.

Think about the things that make this person who they are. Some questions you might want to think about:

	- Do they have any family?
	- What’s their job, do they like it?
	- How did they come to live where they do?
	- Do they have any secret talents?
  - Do they have any friends or associates?
  - How did they grow up? Were they close with their family?


Depending on the character you might answer some of these or none at all. You can spend a lot of time going over backstories, so you want that to be comparable to how important the character is to your story.

### What Are Their Goals

Very closely related to the backstory is the characters goals. In a lot of cases how they’ve come to be where they are now is going to directly affect where they’re going.

For example, if a person’s family was unjustly imprisoned then they are probably looking for ways to get back at whoever was behind it. The best way to build goals is to directly tie them into the backstory. It helps the characters seem real, and gives a clear reason why this character has these goals.

Here’s some example goals:

	- Avenge a family death
	- Open a shop in town
	- Move to the big city
	- Get rich
	- Provide for their family


### A Memorable Trait

Not entirely necessary, but it helps to give characters something unique about them that the players can associate with them. This might be something physical like a scar or outfit, or something about the person’s life like where they live or work.

This helps your players remember the NPC and gives them a point of reference to refer back to. “That dude with the peg leg” is something your players will remember much better than the 50th guy we met in a tavern.

Keep in mind though that any characteristics should make sense. If you give a guy a peg leg then there should probably be a reason he has it, even if he doesn’t want to reveal it just yet.


### Why the PCs Are Interacting with Them

Lastly, it’s important to define what role the character is playing in your story and why the players should be interacting with them. An NPC needs to be interesting to the players for it to be worth spending the time to flesh them out. Believe me, there’s nothing worse than spending a ton of time building a cool character only to have the players ignore them.

Taking the shopkeeper from above that has his family unjustly imprisoned, maybe he holds a grudge against a local lord who was responsible. It just so happens that it’s the same lord that the players are opposed to. Now there’s some backstory that presents a possible path for the characters to reach their goals.

Remember, a good NPC is only good if it takes part in your story. The most interesting NPC in the world with a 50 page backstory is no use if the players ignore them.


## Other Things To Keep In Mind

While the above 4 keys are enough to build great characters, there’s a lot of other things to keep in mind. This next section covers some of these additional things you should keep in mind. When handled properly they can add a lot to help the believability of your NPCs.


## How Location Influences

People from different locations have tons of differences; customs, language, accents, professions, religions, just to name a few. Incorporating these regional differences not only helps build your characters but also helps make your world feel alive.

Thinking about how your characters were shaped and influenced by their locations really helps them feel like they are a part of the world. A person who grew up on a farm is likely to have a very different perspective than the noble in a far away kingdom.


One word of caution though, if you do start introducing location specific quirks they should be consistent. If a town has a “British accent” then everyone in the town should likely have it or have a good reason not to. This can make for interesting clues, the only guy in town without the accent might not be from there.


## Not All At Once

Another important thing I keep in mind is how people open up to others in real life. In most cases, people don’t open up right away to strangers, especially about bad memories.

The shopkeeper above might be more than happy to talk about his archery career, but is likely a bit more guarded about his family's imprisonment. There’s nothing wrong with an NPC being a bit guarded and not wanting to talk about certain things.

I take a sort of drip-feed approach where an NPC will open up more as he builds trust with the players. This is not only more believable, but also adds a sense of progression to the individual stories of the characters. This can lead to sub-plots or trust building hooks that can take the players on unexpected side quests.

## Show Don’t Tell

This is a more general story telling technique, but I feel it fits well with creating NPCs as well. It’s often more effective to show a trait about someone than it is to simply tell the players.

You might want to introduce an evil villain that the characters will go up against. You could describe him as evil and that would do the job, but it would be much more effective to show him being evil. Maybe he captures one of the player’s friends and kills them. That clearly falls in line with being evil, but is much more effective than just saying “yea he’s evil”.

## People Change

One thing that I think is overlooked is the change that people and locations go through. If the players are out adventuring for a year and return it’s likely things have changed in their absence. Maybe people have died, or shops have closed; these types of events can have drastic effects on characters.

It’s also fun to tie these types of events into the hooks you’ve already laid for the characters. Maybe the lord found out about the shopkeeper's plan to overthrow him and used his political power to close the shop. This not only builds a more living world, but also adds some time constraints to the party. If they neglect to pick up quests they might not be there when they get back.



## Creating Quick Characters

To round things off, I wanted to provide a simple method you can use to create quick characters. These types of characters are perfect for populating a tavern or adding a bit of depth to your world.

They key is that they look deep on first glance, and will feel like a fleshed out character through a brief conversation. It also gives you enough to go off if the players take an interest in them. You can use this method to start the character and then come back and flesh them out if the players like them.

The method involves combining a couple of random tables to give you lots of options in creating characters. Below you’ll find a couple that should serve for a handful of characters, but you can always expand the tables or change them up. Feel free to add or remove items from each table to better fit with your world or a specific location.

Important to note that these tables are fairly general, and that’s on purpose. They’re meant to encompass a wide range of characters and give only a brief insight into who they are. I encourage you to flesh them out a bit more to give them a bit more depth that fits the themes of your world.
