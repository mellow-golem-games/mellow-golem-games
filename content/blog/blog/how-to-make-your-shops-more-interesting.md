A common activity in my games is shopping. My players love to roll into a new city, and explore all the shops it has to offer and spend their hard earned gold. I’ve even had it where entire 3 hour sessions were taken up with shopping and lots of roleplay. These have been some of the most fun sessions we’ve had, but they lived or died by how interesting the city and shops are.

Now, there’s a lot that goes into making an interesting city to explore, but here I want to just look at the shops themselves and how to make them interesting to visit. First, we’ll take a look at creating fun and believable shops, then I’ll list out 10 more exotic ideas than just another weaponsmith or general Store. Lastly, we’ll look at an example of a shop I recently used in one of our games.

Note that a lot of this is tips I’ve picked up from running my game which includes players who enjoy a good bit of roleplaying. If you’re a more hack and slash style group then some of the below might be a bit overkill for your games. Pick and choose what fits your group, there’s nothing wrong with that.

## Think About What Shops Should Be in a City

If you’re looking to create a believable world you first want to think about what types of shops might be in a city. The larger a city the more types of shops are naturally going to be sustainable. A small town of 100 people can’t support two dozen blacksmiths, but a huge metropolis might. In larger cities, you might also see people start to specialize while a smaller town is likely to be more general.

Luxury shops are also to be more likely in larger, richer cities. That also brings up another good point, the location in the city matters too. You likely won’t see a high class jewelry in the slums unless something fishy is going on. A medieval era city isn’t going to have easy transportation around it, so shops are likely to be close to their intended clients.

## Location Matters Too

Location in terms of where the city is will also have an effect on the industries and shops that fit there. A town in a dense forest might have several woodworkers, while a desert oasis town probably won’t. Take some time to think about the average person in your town and what they might do or want. These types of questions can help create a more realistic depiction of what shops would be in a specific area.

Make the shop interesting
Outside of realism you also want to make the activity fun. If your group is anything like mine they get a lot out of role playing and exploring, so I don’t want to just say here’s the shops available and the inventory/ prices. Getting to and shopping can be an adventure in of itself if you want it to be.

## Getting To The Shop

Cities can be big, and it might take hours to get to (or find) a particular shop. There’s a lot of room there to make things interesting. I like to use this travel time as a way to weave in plot hooks, or explore previous hooks that make sense in the city. Other times I might throw a small random encounter at them to liven things up a bit and keep them on their toes. I don’t do this all the time though, sometimes they make it there uneventfully. I find this a great way to keep the players engaged, as well as an easy way to sow interest in exploring other parts of the city.

## The Shopkeeper

The shopkeep themselves is also another opportunity to inject some fun into the game. Even if the shop is fairly generic the owner doesn’t have to be, and this is a good way to help each location feel unique. I like to make sure every shop owner has at the very least a unique name and in many cases something unique about them. There’s a ton of random generators that come up with NPCs, and for generic shopkeepers I’ll use these to get some personality traits down quickly. It’s a small thing, but really adds a lot of depth to the world for your players.

It’s also important to remember that shopkeepers are their own people with their motivations, desires, and goals. It takes a bit more work and I won’t do this for everyone, but there’s no reason a shopkeeper can’t be the source of a plot hook. A group of armed adventures enters their store, perhaps this is the perfect time for themto eliminate a rival? It helps here to have some of the dynamics of the city planned out, and then working the shopkeeper into them somehow. It can be a bit unexpected when a simple shopping trip turns into a multi session quest!

## Other Patrons

It’s also important to consider the other patrons in the shop and what they might be doing. They can help, hinder, or just be there to add some flair and act as role playing opportunities. All the same things with the shopkeepers above, so think about why they might be there, and what type of interactions they might take with the players. It’s also perfectly fine for them to just be dressing and make the world feel alive, the players might never interact with them but that doesn’t mean they were wasted.

## 10 Unique Shops

Here’s a list of 10 unique shops I have used at some point in my games. It’s important to keep all the above ideas in mind as they can take a mundane shop to extraordinary.

**Cobbler:** A simple shoe make, everyone needs shoes after all right? Perhaps he can make a fine pair for an evening with the king, or, if brought the proper ingredients, a magic pair enchanted with whatever you desire. I think shoes are an often overlooked part of adventuring, and can use a bit of love.

**Furniture:** A bit of an oddball, but a large city is likely to have a place for nobles to purchase furniture for their homes. This could be an interesting shop if your players buy property and are looking to finish it. Or, maybe an important noble has tasked the players with finding the perfect armchair, not all quests need to be about slaying dragons.

**Perfume:** Who doesn’t love to smell nice? For the outgoing players a bit of perfume can help them on their charisma checks later in the game. Maybe the perfume maker dabbles as an alchemist and the perfume has magical properties to those that smell it. Perhaps those magical properties are harmful, and this particular person has nefarious goals in mind.

**Clearance Magic:** Are your players a bit strapped for cash but looking to add some magic to their arsenal? Maybe that seedy shop in the alley might have what they’re looking for. The clearance magic shop has lots of great magical items at even better prices. Best part is they all work, well errr sometimes they do. I mean 100% of the time they will do something, just maybe not exactly what you were expecting.

**Stone Mason:** Another good one for players that are looking to build some property a stone mason (or an appropriate material building craftsman) could be their first step to do so. What’s great here is that an undertaking like this has a lot of opportunity for side plots. Maybe they need to gather the gold or raw materials, or maybe they need to petition the local lord for permission to build. This is a bit different than your pop in shop, but interesting nonetheless. You might also drop it early in a campaign to give a party a long term side goal to work towards. The idea that they’re working to 100k gold might change some of the choices they make.

**Enchanter:** Turning something mundane into the extraordinary; that’s the role of the enchanter. This is another one that might have the opportunity for adventure as the cost for an interesting enchanter might be in gold or exotic materials. This is also a nice opportunity for players to really customize their character with unique magic. Balance might be difficult here when going off book, so I like to make it take time for the enchanter to research (with a gold cost) a particularly difficult enchant. This gives an in universe reason for me to take time to figure out what power level that would put an item on.

**Black Market Inn:** A twist on the classic tavern, the black market tavern is one where there’s a little something shady going on in the basement. This adds a little depth to the classic tavern formula, but be careful not to overdo this one. One thing you can do is vary the sort of activity that’s going on. Maybe one is actively selling dark magic, while another might just be illegal gambling. You can also subvert expectations a bit and put the seedy tavern in the nicer part of town where you might not expect to see it.

**Marbles And Bobbles:** This is a very unique shop that sells marbles and small balls. It seems a bit odd, but I imagine there might be a toy shop or similar somewhere in a large enough city. You might even make some of them magical, which can be a neat way to get some unique items into your world.

**Tourist Trap (nick-nacks and trinkets):** Not every shop is there to benefit you, some just want to make a quick buck. Enter the tourist trap, an overpriced shop of useless junk. They won’t let you know that though, and will do whatever they can to sell you on their wares. This is also a good opportunity to show the local culture as my image of a tourist trap is cheap nick nacks that have some tie to the city. Think of the medieval version of the I Love NY t-shirt.

**Pawn Shop:** Last up we have the pawn shop, which I look at is a take on the general store. Maybe a bit more rough around the edges, but with a bit of non-traditional items available for purchase. A pawn shop is also a good way to work different factions into your city as I like to think in many cases this type of shop would be backed by them, for protection for instance. I also like the idea of a pawn shop as sort of a front for various players in the city, and might be a good place to start subplots throughout the city.

## My Example Shop
Lastly, I wanted to give an example of a shop I’ve used in one of my games. This particular shop is a big generic, a robe shop, but I wanted to show how added details can help even a pretty typical shop come to life. Note that I don’t put this much detail into every single shop. This one I knew for a fact one of my players would look for so I knew time spent on it would not be wasted. Enjoy.

**Name:** The Finest Thread

**Type:** Tailor and Robes

**General Description:** The Finest Thread is a tailor that specializes in robes located in a wealthy part of the city. The typical clientele are aristocrats, although the large wizard population in the city also frequents it. The shop is well known for its quality as well as its high prices. You won’t find finer made robes anywhere else in the city though, so many are more than happy to pay.

The building itself is a small, two story building made of white stone nestled between two similar buildings. The majority of buildings on the main street of this district look the same, but a large sign out front tells what each shop is. The first floor is a typical shop with racks of different robes for sale. There’s a small door in the rear of the shop that leads up a set of stairs to a small room where the shop keeper lives right above the store. At any given time there might be 2-3 other patrons in the store, but none of them are of much interest and will engage in pleasant but brief conversations if approached.

**The Owner:** The owner of the store is an vibrant gnome who goes only by the name of Fizzle. He’s a bit eccentric and tends to talk quickly and excitedly. He dresses in a pink suit, and carries a small cane that is solely for decoration. He will have a lot to say about any particular robe, and has a habit of talking long past when anyone is listening.

Fizzle is also very passionate about his work, and will accost anyone who disrespects the cloth and thread. Due to this, he also places a high value on his work, and will not be easily haggled. His one weakness is a fondness for gems, and is likely to pay above market value for most types of precious gemstones and is happy to trade robes for such treasures.

**Stock:** The majority of Fizzle’s wares are ordinary if not exquisitely made robes. Close inspection will show a number of them have gemstones set into them, a clue to Fizzle’s vice. These should be treated as normal robes for all purposes except price, in which they should receive a hefy markup depending on the gems they contain.

If asked, Fizzle will have a number of magical robes he’s willing to sell. These will be perfectly well maintained, and will be exactly as described. Fizzle is an expert, and therefore will know all the properties of the robes he sells. In general, any magical robes he has will be roughly 20% more than the expected cost.

Fizzle may be interested in buying magical robes that are unique, but will insist on haggling with players for a deal. He has no reservations of walking away from a sale if the price isn’t right, so he’s a tough negotiator. He will also be very difficult to fool, and will know the properties of all but the most rare robes at a glance.
