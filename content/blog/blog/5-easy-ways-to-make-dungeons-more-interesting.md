Dungeons are the lifeblood of many RPG games and one the key locations players will encounter. The issue is that a lot of times dungeons can feel a bit bland and more like a gauntlet of combat than a living location. That can be fine in some cases, but other times you want there to be a bit more meat to the dungeon. In this article, we’ll look at 5 ways you can add more life to your dungeons and make them a bit more interesting.


## Tell A Story

A good way to add some interest to a dungeon is to tell a story. That’s not necessarily saying that there has to be some quest linked to a dungeon, but the dungeon itself should tell a story.

Think about why the dungeon is there and what types of inhabitants it contains. Does the purpose of a dungeon and who lives there change how it looks and feels? In most cases the answer is yes.

For example, an old dwarven mine is going to look different than a naturally occurring cave home to a bear. Think about how these two areas are going to differ and use that to help tell the story of your dungeon.

The idea here is to paint a picture and show the players that this dungeon exists for more than just them. This helps it feel alive, and adds some non-combat exploration and story to an otherwise combat heavy location.


## Add Puzzles

Puzzles are a great way to spruce up a dungeon and add some non-combat encounters. Puzzles add variety to a dungeon, and good ones are very memorable.

Like combat, you can tailor puzzles to the difficulty appropriate for your group. Easy puzzles can add a break between combat, while harder ones can be longer affairs that take time to work out.

One thing I like to do with puzzles, especially harder ones, is prepare extra clues that I can drop throughout the game. So, if players are taking too long to solve a particular one I can give them subtle hints that help them along. This keeps up the pace of the game while still giving the players that sense of accomplishment for solving a difficult puzzle.


## Use Traps

Similar to puzzles, traps can add more encounters without having to add additional combat to your dungeon. Traps can add suspense, and force the players to think about how they approach different scenarios. This is especially true in combat as your dungeon's inhabitants likely already know where traps are and can use them to their advantage.

Building on from traps, you can also make complex traps. Complex traps are more than just a simple pit or arrow trap, but multi-piece hazards that take time to successfully conquer. Think like a room that is slowly filling with water, and the players only have a few minutes to figure out how to escape. These end up being more like combat encounters than traditional traps, and can add some variety to your game.




## Tie it into the larger story

Tying your dungeons into the larger story is also a great way to make them interesting. This doesn’t mean they have to be part of the main story at all, but leaving clues throughout the dungeon can help it feel connected to the larger world and plot.


For example, maybe the player stumbles upon the journal of one of the main villains in the dungeon. It details how they used this area to help prepare in secret for their super evil plot. Things like that are easy enough to add to a dungeon and add depth to a dungeon. It’s no longer a generic cave system, but a place of importance to a key character.

They don’t always have to be as big as the villain's journal. Maybe it's something that ties into a small sub-plot. As always, it just needs to make sense why it’s there, or it will feel out of place and jarring.

## Create Interesting Encounters

Lastly, I like to tailor some of my combat encounters to fit with the theme of the dungeon. This goes back to telling a story, and making things feel like they belong there. If you randomly stick a dragon into your dungeon you better have a reason it’s there or it will feel out of place.

Going back to the dwarf example above, maybe one of them started experimenting with dark magic that backfired and turned them all undead. You could leave clues to this throughout the dungeon leading up to a battle with the undead dwarves themselves.

Another option is to use the environment as part of the encounter. Crossing an old, rickey bridge across a chasm is cool, but being attacked by flying monsters while you do it is even better. Use your imagination and remember that any intelligent creature is going to use their surroundings to their advantage.
